Ramadan Coding Nights â€“ Building & Learning ðŸš€

Late-night coding during Ramadan brings a unique kind of motivation! ðŸŒŸ I spent my night building a To-Do List App using Python and refining my skills step by step.

What I Did:
âœ… Designed a simple CLI-based To-Do List Manager.
âœ… Implemented features like adding, viewing, deleting, and searching tasks.
âœ… Enhanced user interaction with validation and structured prompts.
âœ… Tested functionality to ensure smooth performance.
